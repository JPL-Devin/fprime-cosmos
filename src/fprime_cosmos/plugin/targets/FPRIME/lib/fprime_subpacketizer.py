"""Splits an F Prime channelized telemetry packet into one COSMOS subpacket per channel

F Prime's TlmChan component concatenates channel records (id, time, value) into a single
downlink packet. Each channel is declared as a COSMOS SUBPACKET keyed on the channel id, so
this subpacketizer identifies records one at a time from the CHANNELS block and emits them
alongside the parent packet.
